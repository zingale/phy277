Homework #2
***********

Some of the problems for this assignment ask you to record commands /
output.  Create a *single text file* in ``nano`` called
``homework2.txt`` with this information and upload it to Brightspace
for the assignment.

.. important::

   All work must be your own.

   You may not use generative AI / large-language models for any part
   of this assignment.

1. *scp practice*

   * On your laptop or one of the MathLab machines, create a file of
     the form :samp:`{username}.txt`, where you replace
     :samp:`{username}` with your ``portal`` username / NetID.

   * Using ``scp`` (or ``pscp`` if you are using Windows / PuTTY), transfer
     the file to ``portal.mathlab.stonybrook.edu`` into the directory
     ``/home/phy277_spr26``.

     This is a directory that is world readable / writable.

   * Copy the exact ``scp`` command you used and the output from the
     transfer when you did it on the command line (this will show, for
     instance, the transfer speed, percentage complex, etc.) and put it
     in your ``homework2.txt`` file that you will submit for this assignment.

.. admonition:: Completing this assignment

   For the each of the problems below, write a separate C++ program
   named in the problem :samp:`problem{N}.cpp`, where :samp:`{N}` is the
   problem number.

   **Make sure your code compiles with ``g++``**.

   Upload your C++ source files (*not the executables produced by
   ``g++``) to Brightspace.

.. important::

   All work must be your own.

   You may not use generative AI / large-language models for any part
   of this assignment.



1. Write a program to compute 0.3 / 0.1 - 3.  Output with enough
   precision to see if you get the expected result.

2. Quadratic formula options

3. Integrer overflow: short type -- print out maximum value
   initialize an int to the maximum value and add 1
   print out result

Homework #1
***********

For this assignment, create a *single text file* in a ``nano`` called
``homework1.txt`` and provide the sequence of commands needed for
each problem.

.. note::

   You may not use generative AI / large-language models for any part
   of this assignment.


1. Starting in your home directory:

   * Create directory structure:

     .. code:: bash

        ~/homework/1/files/

   * Now move into the ``files/`` sub-directory you created, and create
     a file called ``problem.txt`` using the ``touch`` command.

2. For this problem we will use the same directory-structure/files
   from the shell lessons (see :ref:`sec:shell-sample-data` to remember
   how to get this).

   * Change to the directory:

     .. code:: bash

        ~/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes

   * Now make a subdirectory under that called ``tests/``
     and change directory into ``tests/``.

   * From within ``tests/`` copy the files ``cubane.pdb``
     ``ethane.pdb``, and ``octane.pdb`` into your current
     directory.  You should use a single command for it.

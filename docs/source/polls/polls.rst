**********************
In-class Participation
**********************

These forms serve as feedback for me to see how well we are
understanding the material.  They will contribute to the 5%
"participation credit" portion of your course grade.

.. note::

   The lowest 2 scores are dropped---this basically means that you can
   miss 2 classes that have participation activities without penalty.

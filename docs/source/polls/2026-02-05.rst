   There are no wrong answers.  This is for participation credit, and
   is intended to let me know how well we understand the material at
   this point.

Question 1
==========

You created a text file in your current directory with your analysis, and named it
(incorrectly / misspelled) as ``analyis.txt``.

What command could you use to give the file the correct spelling (``analysis.txt``)?

.. dropdown:: solution

   .. prompt:: bash

      mv analyis.txt analysis.txt


Question 2
==========

The ``cat`` command can concatenate files.  That is, if you have files
``begin.txt`` and ``end.txt`` representing two halves of a dataset, you
can concatenate them (display one after another) by doing:

.. prompt:: bash

   cat begin.txt end.txt

Suppose you wanted to create a file called ``whole.txt`` that has the
two halves together in the single file.  How do you think you could
use ``cat`` to create this ``while.txt`` file?

.. dropdown:: solution

   .. prompt:: bash

      cat begin.txt end.txt > whole.txt

Question 3
==========

Imagine you have the following files:

::

   hello
   hello.cpp
   hello.H
   main
   main.cpp


Using the wildcards we learned, what pattern would match just
the files ``hello.cpp`` and ``hello.H``?

.. dropdown:: solution

   .. code:: bash

      hello.*

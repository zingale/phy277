What About AI?
==============

We hear a lot today about `artificial intelligence
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence>`_ (AI).  This
is a big topic, and there are many aspect of AI that are useful in
physics and astronomy, for instance, in classifying data and finding
patterns.

Most of you have been exposed to ChatGPT and similar
tools---these fall into the category of `large language models
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model>`_ (LLMs).  These are
tools that are trained on vast datasets that then predict output past on a query.

While LLMs can be useful for programming, it is important to first
understand the concepts behind programming, including how to organize
data, create logic, write tests, and more.  This is because LLMs make
mistakes (sometimes confidently) and you may not realize it.  So tools
like LLMs may help with writing some initial code, but shift the
burden onto verifying that the code is correct and writing tests.

Some research shows that `using AI leads to longer code reviews and
more mistakes <https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/ai_code_bugs>`_.

Over-reliance on AI also may `prevent you from building necessary
technical skills <https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245>`_.

.. important::

   In this class we will not use LLMs for writing code.  This extends to
   your homework assignments.

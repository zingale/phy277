We want to learn the ways that physicists and astronomer use computers
for research.  Our goal is to cover:

* `Unix <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix>`_  and the `Unix shell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell>`_

  This differs from the Windows or Mac OS that you might be most
  familiar with, but allows for powerful file manipulation and use of
  remote computing resources.

* `Editors <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor>`_

  These are tools that allow us to write computer programs as plain
  text, and often have features that ease code development.

* `C++ programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B>`_

  C++ is a popular language for scientific computing.  We will learn
  how to use it to store and manipulate data and do complex
  calculations.  This includes learning about:

  * Datatypes

  * the Standard Library and containers

  * Functions and Classes

* `Software engineering concepts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering>`_

  There are a variety of tools that make our life easier as a
  programmer.  We will learn about:

  * Version control with git

  * Testing

  * Build systems

* Some other useful skills

  * Creating webpages

  * `LaTeX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX>`_

  * Plotting

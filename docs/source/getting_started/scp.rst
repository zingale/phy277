******************************
``scp`` and Transferring Files
******************************

When working on a remote machine, we often want to transfer files from
the remote machine to our local computer.  The tool for this is
``scp``, the `secure copy protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol>`_.

.. tip::

   If you are using Windows and using PuTTY, then the ``pscp`` command can be
   used as described here.

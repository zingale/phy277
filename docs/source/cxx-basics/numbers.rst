****************
``std::numbers``
****************

C++20 introduced `mathematical constants
<https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/constants.html>`_ via the
``<numbers>`` header.

For example, we can compute the area of a circle, using the value of $\pi$ from
this library:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/floating_point/circle.cpp
   :language: c++
   :caption: circle.cpp

Spring 2026

Instructor: `Michael Zingale <https://zingale.github.io/>`_


Course description
==================

  An introduction to computing on UNIX/Linux computers. Fundamentals of
  using UNIX/Linux to write computer programs for numerical algorithms
  to solve computational physics and astronomy problems. Assignments are
  carried out in a high-level compiled programming language such as
  modern Fortran or C++ and require extensive use of SINC site computers
  outside the classroom.

Course notes
============

This website will serve as the notes for the class.  Embedded in these
pages is a lot of example code that we will discuss in class.  You
are also *strongly encouraged* to look at the suggested readings at
the top of many pages.

.. note::

   These course notes will be continuously updated throughout the semester.

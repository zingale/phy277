Question 1
==========

We've written a "Hello World" program a number of times.  Without
looking back through the notes, write a simple C++ program that
outputs "Hello, World" to the screen.

.. dropdown:: solution

   Our basic "Hello, World" program is:

   .. code:: c++

      #include <iostream>

      int main() {
          std::cout << "Hello, World" << std::endl;
      }

   Some comments:

   * Statements end with semicolons
   * ``<<`` is the output stream operator, ``>>`` would be for input
   * ``echo`` is a Bash command, not C++
   * ``main`` has a type ``int``, we must specify that.

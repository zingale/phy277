Getting Started
***************

For this class, we will be working with Linux systems and learning to
use the bash command line, C++ programming, and some basic software
engineering techniques.

MathLab
=======

The computers in the MathLab (S-235) have all of the software we
need.  In-class, you will learn how to work on these computers
as we learn about Unix and programming.

Outside of class, there are two machines that are setup for remote
access.  These are:

* ``portal.mathlab.stonybrook.edu``
* ``portal2.mathlab.stonybrook.edu``

We will learn how to remotely connect to these machines in week 1 of the class.

The Terminal
============

Our standard interface to the computer is the command line, accessible
via the terminal app.

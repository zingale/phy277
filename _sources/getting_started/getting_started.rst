Getting Started
***************

For this class, we will be working with Linux systems and learning to
use the bash command line, C++ programming, and some basic software
engineering techniques.

MathLab
=======

The computers in the MathLab (S-235) run an older version of
the `Ubuntu Linux <https://ubuntu.com/>`_ distribution of the `Linux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_ operating system.  We will
mostly use them as terminals to access remote servers that
are more up-to-date.

.. note::

   This actually mimics how we often work in the real world, especially
   using research computing resources.

Logging into the desktops
-------------------------

You username and password for logging into the desktop machines are
those of your NetID.

.. tip::

   If the machines seems non-responsive, you can wake it up by typing:

   :kbd:`CTRL-ALT-F2` followed by :kbd:`CTRL-ALT-F1`.

   Then you should see the login screen.

Once logged in you will want to access the terminal.  On the Ubuntu systems,
access the "Activities" menu in the upper-left and then scroll through the
applications, looking for "Konsole" or "Terminal"

.. important::

   At the end of class, log out.  You can do this by accessing the menu in
   the upper-right of the screen.

The Terminal
============

Our standard interface to the computer is the command line, accessible
via the terminal app.

The terminal is our window to the computer.  It runs an interactive
shell called `Bash <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>`_
that we enter commands into.

.. admonition:: Try it...

   A simple Unix command is ``echo``.  It simply repeats whatever you
   type:

   .. prompt:: bash

      echo Hello, World!

   Type this in, and then press :kbd:`Enter`.

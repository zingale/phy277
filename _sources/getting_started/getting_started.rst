Getting Started
***************

For this class, we will be working with Linux systems and learning to
use the bash command line, C++ programming, and some basic software
engineering techniques.

You may use either your own computer or the computers in the MathLab.


MathLab
=======

The MathLab computers are running an older version of Ubuntu Linux,
and they are not ideal platforms for the coursework in this class.
For this reason, we will connect to two servers ``portal`` and
``portal2`` to work remotely.


Using your own computer
=======================

If you want to use your own laptop, then you have a few options:

* Use your laptop as a terminal to connect to the remove machines
  setup for this class (``portal`` and ``portal2``).

* Install the Bash shell and compilers on your laptop and develop on
  your machine directly.

  .. note::

     Due to the large variations in personal machines, we cannot support
     software on your personal machine.

* Install a Linux virtual machine on your computer.


Using the remote servers
------------------------

You need to install an ssh client and a X Window client

* Windows:

  putty

* MacOS:

  XQuartz

Using your personal machine directly
------------------------------------

You need to install the Unix shell and compilers

* Windows:

  Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux

  Use Git for Windows (follow Software Carpentry)

* MacOS:

  You should have most of what you need, but other software can be installed via Brew

* Linux:

  You likely have everything you need already for the class
